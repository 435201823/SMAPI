## Log parser
The log parser provides a web UI for uploading, parsing, and sharing SMAPI logs. The logs are
persisted in a compressed form to Pastebin. The log parser lives at https://log.smapi.io.

## JSON validator
### Overview
The JSON validator provides a web UI for uploading and sharing JSON files, and validating them as
plain JSON or against a predefined format like `manifest.json` or Content Patcher's `content.json`.
The JSON validator lives at https://json.smapi.io.

### Schema file format
Schema files are defined in `wwwroot/schemas` using the [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/)
format. The JSON validator UI recognises a superset of the standard fields to change output:

<dl>
<dt>Documentation URL</dt>
<dd>

The root schema may have a `@documentationURL` field, which is a web URL for the user
documentation:
```js
"@documentationUrl": "https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/APIs/Manifest"
```

If present, this is shown in the JSON validator UI.

</dd>
<dt>Error messages</dt>
<dd>

Any part of the schema can define an `@errorMessages` field, which overrides matching schema
errors. You can override by error code (recommended), or by error type and a regex pattern matched
against the error message (more fragile):

```js
// by error type
"pattern": "^[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+\\.dll$",
"@errorMessages": {
   "pattern": "Invalid value; must be a filename ending with .dll."
}
```
```js
// by error type + message pattern
"@errorMessages": {
   "oneOf:valid against no schemas": "Missing required field: EntryDll or ContentPackFor.",
   "oneOf:valid against more than one schema": "Can't specify both EntryDll or ContentPackFor, they're mutually exclusive."
}
```

Error messages may contain special tokens:

* The `@value` token is replaced with the error's value field. This is usually (but not always) the
  original field value.
* When an error has child errors, by default they're flattened into one message:
  ```
  line | field      | error
  ---- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  4    | Changes[0] | JSON does not match schema from 'then'.
       |            |   ==> Changes[0].ToArea.Y: Invalid type. Expected Integer but got String.
       |            |   ==> Changes[0].ToArea: Missing required fields: Height.
  ```

  If you set the message for an error to `$transparent`, the parent error is omitted entirely and
  the child errors are shown instead:
  ```
  line | field               | error
  ---- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------
  8    | Changes[0].ToArea.Y | Invalid type. Expected Integer but got String.
  8    | Changes[0].ToArea   | Missing required fields: Height.
  ```

  The child errors themselves may be marked `$transparent`, etc. If an error has no child errors,
  this override is ignored.

  Validation errors for `then` blocks are transparent by default, unless overridden.

</dd>
</dl>

### Using a schema file directly
You can reference the validator schemas in your JSON file directly using the `$schema` field, for
text editors that support schema validation. For example:
```js
{
   "$schema": "https://smapi.io/schemas/manifest.json",
   "Name": "Some mod",
   ...
}
```

Available schemas:

format | schema URL
------ | ----------
[SMAPI `manifest.json`](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/APIs/Manifest) | https://smapi.io/schemas/manifest.json
[Content Patcher `content.json`](https://github.com/Pathoschild/StardewMods/tree/develop/ContentPatcher#readme) | https://smapi.io/schemas/content-patcher.json

## Web API
### Overview
SMAPI provides a web API at `api.smapi.io` for use by SMAPI and external tools. The URL includes a
`{version}` token, which is the SMAPI version for backwards compatibility. This API is publicly
accessible but not officially released; it may change at any time.

### `/mods` endpoint
The API has one `/mods` endpoint. This crossreferences the mod against a variety of sources (e.g.
the wiki, Chucklefish, CurseForge, ModDrop, and Nexus) to provide metadata mainly intended for
update checks.

The API accepts a `POST` request with these fields:

<table>
<tr>
<th>field</th>
<th>summary</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>mods</code></td>
<td>

The mods for which to fetch metadata. Included fields:


field | summary
----- | -------
`id`  | The unique ID in the mod's `manifest.json`. This is used to crossreference with the wiki, and to index mods in the response. If it's unknown (e.g. you just have an update key), you can use a unique fake ID like `FAKE.Nexus.2400`.
`updateKeys` | _(optional)_ [Update keys](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/APIs/Manifest#Update_checks) which specify the mod pages to check, in addition to any mod pages linked to the `ID`.
`installedVersion` | _(optional)_ The installed version of the mod. If not specified, the API won't recommend an update.
`isBroken` | _(optional)_ Whether SMAPI failed to load the installed version of the mod, e.g. due to incompatibility. If true, the web API will be more permissive when recommending updates (e.g. allowing a stable â†’ prerelease update).

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>apiVersion</code></td>
<td>

_(optional)_ The installed version of SMAPI. If not specified, the API won't recommend an update.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>gameVersion</code></td>
<td>

_(optional)_ The installed version of Stardew Valley. This may be used to select updates.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>platform</code></td>
<td>

_(optional)_ The player's OS (`Android`, `Linux`, `Mac`, or `Windows`). This may be used to select updates.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>includeExtendedMetadata</code></td>
<td>

_(optional)_ Whether to include extra metadata that's not needed for SMAPI update checks, but which
may be useful to external tools.

</td>
</table>

Example request:
```js
POST https://api.smapi.io/v3.0/mods
{
   "mods": [
      {
         "id": "Pathoschild.ContentPatcher",
         "updateKeys": [ "nexus:1915" ],
         "installedVersion": "1.9.2",
         "isBroken": false
      }
   ],
   "apiVersion": "3.0.0",
   "gameVersion": "1.4.0",
   "platform": "Windows",
   "includeExtendedMetadata": true
}
```

Response fields:

<table>
<tr>
<th>field</th>
<th>summary</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>id</code></td>
<td>

The mod ID you specified in the request.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>suggestedUpdate</code></td>
<td>

The update version recommended by the web API, if any. This is based on some internal rules (e.g.
it won't recommend a prerelease update if the player has a working stable version) and context
(e.g. whether the player is in the game beta channel). Choosing an update version yourself isn't
recommended, but you can set `includeExtendedMetadata: true` and check the `metadata` field if you
really want to do that.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>errors</code></td>
<td>

Human-readable errors that occurred fetching the version info (e.g. if a mod page has an invalid
version).

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>metadata</code></td>
<td>

Extra metadata that's not needed for SMAPI update checks but which may be useful to external tools,
if you set `includeExtendedMetadata: true` in the request. Included fields:

field | summary
----- | -------
`id`  | The known `manifest.json` unique IDs for this mod defined on the wiki, if any. That includes historical versions of the mod.
`name` | The normalised name for this mod based on the crossreferenced sites.

`customUrl` | The custom URL to the mod page, if any. This is used for mods which aren't stored on one of the standard mod sites covered by the ID fields.
`main` | The primary mod version, if any. This depends on the mod site, but it's typically either the version of the mod itself or of its latest non-optional download.
`optional` | The latest optional download version, if any.
`unofficial` | The version of the unofficial update defined on the wiki for this mod, if any.
`unofficialForBeta` | Equivalent to `unofficial`, but for beta versions of SMAPI or Stardew Valley.

## For SMAPI developers
### Local environment
A local environment lets you run a complete copy of the web project (including cache database) on
your machine, with no external dependencies aside from the actual mod sites.

Initial setup:

1. [Install MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/) and add its
   `bin` folder to the system PATH.
2. Create a local folder for the MongoDB data (e.g. `C:\dev\smapi-cache`).
3. Enter your credentials in the `appsettings.Development.json` file. You can leave the MongoDB
   credentials as-is to use the default local instance; see the next section for the other settings.

To launch the environment:
1. Launch MongoDB from a terminal (change the data path if applicable):
    ```sh
    mongod --dbpath C:\dev\smapi-cache
    ```
2. Launch `SMAPI.Web` from Visual Studio to run a local version of the site.  
    <small>(Local URLs will use HTTP instead of HTTPS, and subdomains will become routes, like
    `log.smapi.io` &rarr; `localhost:59482/log`.)</small>

### Production environment
A production environment includes the web servers and cache database hosted online for public
access. This section assumes you're creating a new production environment from scratch (not using
the official live environment).

Initial setup:

1. Launch an empty MongoDB server (e.g. using [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)).
2. Create an AWS Beanstalk .NET environment with these environment properties:

   property name                   | description
   ------------------------------- | -----------------
   `LogParser:PastebinDevKey`      | The [Pastebin developer key](https://pastebin.com/api#1) used to authenticate with the Pastebin API.
   `LogParser:PastebinUserKey`     | The [Pastebin user key](https://pastebin.com/api#8) used to authenticate with the Pastebin API. Can be left blank to post anonymously.
   `LogParser:SectionUrl`          | The root URL of the log page, like `https://log.smapi.io/`.
   `ModUpdateCheck:GitHubPassword` | The password with which to authenticate to GitHub when fetching release info.
   `ModUpdateCheck:GitHubUsername` | The username with which to authenticate to GitHub when fetching release info.
   `MongoDB:Host`                  | The hostname for the MongoDB instance.
   `MongoDB:Username`              | The login username for the MongoDB instance.
   `MongoDB:Password`              | The login password for the MongoDB instance.
   `MongoDB:Database`              | The database name (e.g. `smapi` in production or `smapi-edge` in testing environments).

To deploy updates:
1. Deploy the web project using [AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/visualstudio/).
2. If the MongoDB schema changed, delete the MongoDB database. (It'll be recreated automatically.)
